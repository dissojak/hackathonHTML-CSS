## Overview
This project is a simple, well-structured static front-end demo built with plain HTML and CSS. It contains multiple screen layouts (desktop / tablet / mobile) and reusable components (navigation, cards, forms, and footer) suitable for hackathon prototyping.

Goals:
- Rapidly prototype screen designs
- Keep markup semantic and accessible
- Keep styles modular and easy to adapt

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/dissojak/hackathonHTML-CSS.git
2. Change directory:
   cd hackathonHTML-CSS
3. Open `index.html` directly in your browser. (No build step is required.)

Optional: run a simple static server for convenience:
- Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` and visit http://localhost:8000

## Project structure
A typical layout for this repo (adjust to match the actual files in the repository):

- index.html — main entry page  
- /styles/ — CSS files (reset, base, components, layout)  
- /assets/ — images, icons, fonts  
- /docs/screenshots/ — example screenshots (placeholders)

## Screens / Design captures

Recommended screenshot sizes:
- Desktop: ~1920×1080  (no sure 80%)

Placeholders (replace with your images and captions):

- Home / Landing (Desktop)

  Caption: Desktop layout of the landing page.

## Styles & conventions
- CSS is organized to keep components reusable:
  - reset.css / normalize.css
  - base.css (typography, variables)
  - layout.css (grid, containers)
  - components.css (buttons, cards, nav)
- Use CSS custom properties for colors and spacing where possible.
- Prefer semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, nav, section, footer).

## Accessibility & responsiveness
- Ensure images have descriptive alt text.
- Use logical heading order (h1 → h2 → h3).
- Include keyboard-focus styles for interactive elements.
- Build layouts mobile-first and enhance for larger viewports.
